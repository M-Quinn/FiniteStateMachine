# FiniteStateMachine
created in Unity 2021.3

This was a project to demonstrate my ability to create a finite state machine. The blue capsules represent rabbits, the red capsules represent wolves, and the green cubes represent plant life. They each eat and reproduce through the power of the finite state machine.

This project includes:

 - Interfaces
 - Delegates
 - Polymorphism
 - Lambda Expressions
 - A Finite State Machine created in C#
